8011 - The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The reason that the system could not register these RRs was because (a) either the DNS server does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol, or (b) the authoritative zone where these records are to be registered does not allow dynamic updates. To register DNS pointer (PTR) resource records using the specific DNS domain name and IP addresses for this adapter, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator.
8012 - The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The reason that the system could not register these RRs was because the DNS server refused the update request. The cause of this could be (a) your computer is not allowed to update the adapter-specified DNS domain name, or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for the specified name does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol. To register the DNS pointer (PTR) resource records using the specific DNS domain name and IP addresses for this adapter, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator.
8013 - The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The reason that the system could not register these RRs was because of a security related problem. The cause of this could be (a) your computer does not have permissions to register and update the specific DNS domain name set for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server during the processing of the update request. You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator.
8014 - The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The reason the system could not register these RRs during the update request was because of a system problem. You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator. See event details for specific error code information.
8015 - The system failed to register host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the update request it sent to the DNS server timed out. The most likely cause of this is that the DNS server authoritative for the name it was attempting to register or update is not running at this time. You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator.
8016 - %1 Extension (%2) requests a sync mode process.
8017 - The system failed to register host (A or AAAA) resource records for network adapter Either the DNS server does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol or the authoritative zone for the specified DNS domain name does not accept dynamic updates. To register the DNS host (A or AAAA) resource records using the specific DNS domain name and IP addresses for this adapter, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator.
8018 - The system failed to register host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the DNS server contacted refused the update request. The reasons for this might be (a) you are not allowed to update the specified DNS domain name, or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for this name does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol. To register the DNS host (A or AAAA) resource records using the specific DNS domain name and IP addresses for this adapter, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator.
8019 - The system failed to register host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The reason the system could not register these RRs was because of a security related problem. The cause of this could be (a) your computer does not have permissions to register and update the specific DNS domain name set for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server during the processing of the update request. You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator. See event details for specific error code information.
8020 - Device installation is currently disabled.
8021 - Device installation has been disabled.
8022 - Device installation has been enabled. The reason for this failure is because the DNS server sent the update either (a) does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol, or (b) the authoritative zone for the specified DNS domain name does not currently accept DNS dynamic updates. The reason the system could not perform the update request was the DNS server contacted refused update request. The cause of this is (a) this computer is not allowed to update the specified DNS domain name, or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for the zone that requires updating does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol. The reason the system could not perform the update request was because of a security related problem. The cause of this could be (a) your computer does not have permissions to register and update the specific DNS domain name set for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server during the processing of the update request. See event details for specific error code information. The system could not update to remove this DNS registration because of a system problem. See event details for specific error code information.
8027 - The system failed to update and remove pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The system could not remove these PTR RRs because the update request timed out while awaiting a response from the DNS server. This is probably because the DNS server authoritative for the zone that requires update is not running.
8028 - The system failed to update and remove pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The system could not remove these PTR RRs because the DNS server failed the update request. A possible cause is that a zone transfer is in progress, causing a lock for the zone at the DNS server authorized to perform the updates for these RRs.
8029 - The system failed to update and remove pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The system could not remove these PTR RRs because either the DNS server does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol or the authoritative zone that contains these RRs does not accept dynamic updates.
8030 - The DeviceInstall service will not idle stop.
8031 - The system failed to update and remove pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The system could not remove these PTR RRs because of a security related problem. The cause of this could be that (a) your computer does not have permissions to remove and update the specific DNS domain name or IP addresses configured for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server during the processing of the update request. See event details for specific error code information.
8032 - The system failed to update and remove pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The system could not remove these PTR RRs because because of a system problem. See event details for specific error code information.
8033 - The system failed to update and remove host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The system could not remove these host (A or AAAA) RRs because the update request timed out while awaiting a response from the DNS server. This is probably because the DNS server authoritative for the zone where these RRs need to be updated is either not currently running or reachable on the network.
8034 - The system failed to update and remove host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The system could not remove these host (A or AAAA) RRs because the DNS server failed the update request. A possible cause is that a zone transfer is in progress, causing a lock for the zone at the DNS server authorized to perform the updates for these RRs.
8035 - The system failed to update and remove host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The reason for this failure is because the DNS server sent the update either (a) does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol, or (b) the authoritative zone for the DNS domain name specified in these host (A or AAAA) RRs does not currently accept DNS dynamic updates.
8036 - The system failed to update and remove host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The request to remove these records failed because the DNS server refused the update request. The cause of this might be that either (a) this computer is not allowed to update the DNS domain name specified by these settings, or (b) because the DNS server authorized to perform updates for the zone that contains these RRs does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol.
8037 - The system failed to update and remove host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The reason for this failure was because of a security related problem. The cause of this could be that (a) your computer does not have permissions to remove and update the specific DNS domain name or IP addresses configured for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server during the processing of the update request. See event details for specific error code information.
8038 - The system failed to update and remove host (A or AAAA) resource records (RRs) for network adapter The reason the update request failed was because of a system problem. See event details for specific error code information.

16643 - An initial account-identifier pool has not yet been allocated to this domain controller. A possible reason for this is that the domain controller has been unable to contact the master domain controller, possibly due to connectivity or network problems. Account creation will fail on this domain controller until the pool is obtained.
16644 - The operation failed as the shared VHDX config is Active-Active or, all the guest clustered virtual machines are turned off.
16645 - The maximum account identifier allocated to this domain controller has been assigned. The domain controller has failed to obtain a new identifier pool. A possible reason for this is that the domain controller has been unable to contact the master domain controller. Account creation on this controller will fail until a new pool has been allocated. There may be network or connectivity problems in the domain, or the master domain controller may be offline or missing from the domain. Verify that the master domain controller is running and connected to the domain.
16646 - The computed account identifier is invalid because it is out of the range of the current account-identifier pool belonging to this domain controller. The computed RID value is %1. Try invalidating the account identifier pool owned by this domain controller. This will make the domain controller acquire a fresh account identifier pool.
16647 - The domain controller is starting a request for a new account-identifier pool.
16648 - The request for a new account-identifier pool has completed successfully.
16649 - The account-identifier-manager object creation completed. If the record data for this event has the value zero, the manager object was created. Otherwise, the record data will contain the NT error code indicating the failure. The failure to create the object may be due to low system resources, insufficient memory, or disk space.
16651 - The request for a new account-identifier pool failed. The operation will be retried until the request succeeds. The error is " %1 "
16652 - The domain controller is booting to directory services restore mode.
16653 - A pool size for account-identifiers (RIDs) that was configured by an Administrator is greater than the supported maximum. The maximum value of %1 will be used when the domain controller is the RID master. 1. A domain controller is restored from backup. 2. A domain controller running on a virtual machine is restored from snapshot. 3. An administrator has manually invalidated the pool.
16655 - The global maximum for account-identifiers (RIDs) has been increased to %1. requirements.
16656 - Action required! An account-identifier (RID) pool was allocated to this domain controller. The pool value indicates this domain has consumed a considerable portion of the total available account-identifiers. A protection mechanism will be activated when the domain reaches the following threshold of total available account-identifiers additional users, computers and groups, or promote new DCs into the domain. The mechanism will remain active until the Administrator manually re-enables account-identifier allocation on the RID master domain controller.
16657 - Action required! This domain has consumed a considerable portion of the total available account-identifiers (RIDs). A protection The protection mechanism prevents the allocation of account-identifier (RID) pools needed to allow existing DCs to create additional users, computers and groups, or promote new DCs into the domain. The mechanism will remain active until the Administrator manually re-enables account-identifier (RID) allocation on the RID master domain controller. It is extremely important that certain diagnostics be performed prior to re-enabling account creation to ensure this domain is not consuming account-identifiers at an abnormally high rate. Any issues identified should be resolved prior to re-enabling account creation. Failure to diagnose and fix any underlying issue causing an abnormally high rate of account-identifier consumption can lead to account-identifier (RID) pool exhaustion in the domain after which account creation will be permanently disabled in this domain.
16658 - This event is a periodic update on the remaining total quantity of available account-identifiers (RIDs). The number of remaining Account-identifiers are used as accounts are created, when they are exhausted no new accounts may be created in the domain.

16944 - The certificate that is used for authentication does not have an issuance policy descriptor corresponding to OID %1 in the Active Directory database. This certificate will not be associated with a corresponding security identifier (SID), and the user may be denied access to some resources if you have resources whose access is restricted based on this issuance policy. The error is %2.
16945 - The certificate issuance policy that is represented by OID %2 does not have a link to a security identifier (SID), or this link cannot be read. The link is represented by the attribute msDS-OIDToGroupLink on the msPKI-Enterprise-Oid object that represents the issuance policy. This certificate will not be associated with a corresponding SID, and the user may be denied access to some resources if you have resources whose access is restricted based on this issuance policy.
16946 - Multiple certificate issuance policy descriptors were found in the Active Directory database. The attribute msPKI-Cert-Template-OID of these descriptors contains string %1. This attribute should be able to uniquely identify an issuance policy descriptor; you should resolve this conflict. The issuance policies that are affected will not be associated with security identifiers (SIDs), and users who are authenticating using certificates that are issued by the corresponding policy may be denied access to some resources.
16947 - The certificate issuance policy descriptor %2 is linked through its attribute msDS-OIDToGroupLink to a group that is not a security group, has members, or is not universal. The error is %6. An issuance policy should be linked to a security identifier (SID) of a group that is security enabled, does not have members, and is universal. Users who are authenticating using certificates that are issued according to this policy may be denied access to some resources. The distinguished name (also known as DN) of the group that does not meet these requirements is %3.
16948 - The requested modification for group %1 could not be performed. This is because this group is linked through msDS-OIDToGroupLinkBl to a certificate issuance policy descriptor. Such groups should be security enabled, they should not have any members, and they should be universal. The requested operation was %4. The error is %5.
16949 - The certificate issuance policy descriptor %1 cannot be linked to group %2. Issuance policies can be linked through the attribute msDS-OIDToGroupLink only to universal, security-enabled groups that have an empty membership. You should ensure that this group meets these requirements. The error is %5.

36875 - The remote server has requested TLS client authentication, but no suitable client certificate could be found. An anonymous connection will be attempted. This TLS connection request may succeed or fail, depending on the server's policy settings.
36876 - The certificate received from the remote server has not validated correctly. The error code is %3. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.
36877 - The certificate received from the remote client application has not validated correctly. The error code is %3. The attached data contains the client certificate.
36878 - The certificate received from the remote client application is not suitable for direct mapping to a client system account, possibly because the authority that issuing the certificate is not sufficiently trusted. The error code is %3. The attached data contains the client certificate.
36879 - The certificate received from the remote client application was not successfully mapped to a client system account. The error code is %3. This is not necessarily a fatal error, as the server application may still find the certificate acceptable.
36880 - A TLS %1 handshake completed successfully. The negotiated cryptographic parameters are as follows.
36881 - The certificate received from the remote server has either expired or is not yet valid. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.
36882 - The certificate received from the remote server was issued by an untrusted certificate authority. Because of this, none of the data contained in the certificate can be validated. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.
36883 - The certificate received from the remote server has been revoked. This means that the certificate authority that issued the certificate has invalidated it. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.
36884 - The certificate received from the remote server does not contain the expected name. It is therefore not possible to determine whether we are connecting to the correct server. The server name we were expecting is %3. The TLS connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate.
36885 - When asking for client authentication, this server sends a list of trusted certificate authorities to the client. The client uses this list to choose a client certificate that is trusted by the server. Currently, this server trusts so many certificate authorities that the list has grown too long. This list has thus been truncated. The administrator of this machine should review the certificate authorities trusted for client authentication and remove those that do not really need to be trusted.
36886 - No suitable default server credential exists on this system. This will prevent server applications that expect to make use of the system default credentials from accepting SSL connections. An example of such an application is the directory server. Applications that manage their own credentials, such as the internet information server, are not affected by this.
36887 - A fatal alert was received from the remote endpoint. The TLS protocol defined fatal alert code is %3.
36888 - A fatal alert was generated and sent to the remote endpoint. This may result in termination of the connection. The TLS protocol defined fatal alert code is %3.
