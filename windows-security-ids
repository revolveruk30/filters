4611  - A trusted logon process has been registered with the Local Security Authority. This logon process will be trusted to submit logon requests.
4612  - Internal resources allocated for the queuing of audit messages have been exhausted, leading to the loss of some audits. This event is generated when audit queues are filled and events must be discarded. This most commonly occurs when security events are being generated faster than they are being written to disk, or when the auditing system loses connectivity to the event log, such as when the event log service is stopped.
4614  - A notification package has been loaded by the Security Account Manager. This package will be notified of any account or password changes.
4615  - Invalid use of LPC port. Windows Local Security Authority (LSA) communicates with the Windows kernel using Local Procedure Call (LPC) ports. If you see this event, an application has inadvertently or intentionally accessed this port which is reserved exclusively for LSA's use. The application (process) should be investigated to ensure that it is not attempting to tamper with this communications channel.
4616  - The system time was changed. This event is generated when the system time is changed. It is normal for the Windows Time Service, which runs with System privilege, to change the system time on a regular basis. Other system time changes may be indicative of attempts to tamper with the computer.
4618  - A monitored security event pattern has occurred. This event is generated when Windows is configured to generate alerts in accordance with the Common Criteria Security Audit Analysis requirements (FAU_SAA) and an auditable event pattern occurs.
4621  - Administrator recovered system from CrashOnAuditFail. Users who are not administrators will now be allowed to log on. Some auditable activity might not have been recorded. This event is logged after a system reboots following CrashOnAuditFail.
4622  - A security package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority.
4624  - An account was successfully logged on. This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed. The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe. The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network). The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on. The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases. The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate. The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request. - Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event. - Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request. - Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols. - Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.
4625  - An account failed to log on. This event is generated when a logon request fails. It is generated on the computer where access was attempted. The Subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe. The Logon Type field indicates the kind of logon that was requested. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network). The Process Information fields indicate which account and process on the system requested the logon. The Network Information fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases. The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request. - Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request. - Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols. - Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.
4626  - User / Device claims information. The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe. The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network). The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on. This event is generated when the Audit User/Device claims subcategory is configured and the user’s logon token contains user/device claims information. The Logon ID field can be used to correlate this event with the corresponding user logon event as well as to any other security audit events generated during this logon session.
4627  - Group membership information. The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe. The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network). The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on. This event is generated when the Audit Group Membership subcategory is configured. The Logon ID field can be used to correlate this event with the corresponding user logon event as well as to any other security audit events generated during this logon session.
4634  - An account was logged off. This event is generated when a logon session is destroyed. It may be positively correlated with a logon event using the Logon ID value. Logon IDs are only unique between reboots on the same computer. This event is generated when a logoff is initiated. No further user-initiated activity can occur. This event can be interpreted as a logoff event.
4648  - A logon was attempted using explicit credentials. This event is generated when a process attempts to log on an account by explicitly specifying that account’s credentials. This most commonly occurs in batch-type configurations such as scheduled tasks, or when using the RUNAS command.
4649  - A replay attack was detected. This event indicates that a Kerberos replay attack was detected- a request was received twice with identical information. This condition could be caused by network misconfiguration.
